    <h2 id="zooming"> Zooming</h2>
    <p>
        Zooming plays a crucial role in exploration. When you zoom in, the view shifts closer to the Earth's surface, reducing the area covered. 
        This is ideal for exploring smaller regions, such as local authorities or neighborhoods. On the other hand, zooming out provides a broader 
        perspective, making it suitable for viewing larger areas like states or entire countries. The level of zoom also affects the type of alerts you receive when crossing borders. At a closer zoom level, you'll be notified when crossing district boundaries. 
        Zooming out slightly will trigger alerts only when you cross state (or provincial) borders. At the widest zoom level, alerts are limited to crossing international borders. It is like viewing a place from a helicoptor. When you zoom out, the helicoptor rises up
        and you can view a bigger area. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Zoom level also affects the distance the cursor moves in one arrow key press. If you zoom in, this distance will be decrease. On maximum zoom in, the cursor only travels around 1 kilometer on a sing arrow key press.
        When you are maximum zoomed out. the cursor moves approximately 500 kilometers (This distance can vary depending on the lattitude of the place). So, if you want to navigate a large distance, zooming out would help you reduce the number of key presses.
    </p>

    <p>
            Press <code>Z</code> to hear the distance traveled by the cursor with each arrow key press (this varies by zoom level and latitude).</li>
    </p>
    <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;" href="#top"><button style="width:100%;" >Go to top</button></a>


    <h2 id="inbound-navigation">Inbound navigation (Navigate within a region)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Inbound navigation</strong> helps you stay within a selected place(such as a country) when you want to explore a specific area. 
        It ensures that you don't cross the boundary of the selected place.<br>
        You can enter inbound navigation in two ways. <br>
        1. When you search for a place in the search bar, if that place has boundaries (that is the place is not a point on map such as Taj Mahal), the place gets selected. (Note that this does not work when you search for rivers).<br>
        2. While you navigate using arrow keys, when you press <code>Enter</code>, the current location of the cursor gets selected.<br>
        When you select an area, you will hear an announcement that inbound navigation that The area of selection depends on the current zoom level. That is, if you are zoomed in, only a small place like a local authority will be selected, but when you are zoomed out, the large area such as a country can be selected.<br>
        When you select a place, the cursor is moved to the centre of the selected place and the navigation is limited within the area. When a cursor reaches a boundary, you will be warned that a boundary is reached. 
        You can hear the information about this place by using tab key to get to the informaion bar and using arrow keys to switch between informations.<br>
        Press <code>Alt + M</code> to focus on the map again and continue navigation.
    </p>
<img src="inbound.png" alt="Image of Madagascar selected and selected by pressing enter while navigating. " class="image-side">

    <p>Note: Ensure you are focused on map and focus mode is on when using this feature. If you’re using another feature, press <code>Alt + M</code> to refocus. Press <code>Escape</code> to exit the boundary and continue exploring.</p>

    <h2 id="adjustable-pointer">Know your surroundings (Adjustable pointer)</h2>
    <p>
        The adjustable pointer adds an innovative twist to exploring and comparing distances on the map. Imagine you hold stick in your hand. You can point it to whichever direction you want and adjust the distance it points to by moving your hand. Adjustable pointer is like
        a stick who's length can be changed. With the current location as the centre, you can point to a place that is situated at a distance same as the length of the pointer and at an angle of your choice. Instead of moving your hands, you can use arrow keys to adjust it's length and angle. The north is set as 0 degree and as you rotate clockwise, the angle changes. 
        The east is 90 degree, south is 180 degree and west is 270 degree. In this way you can explore the surroundings of the cursor's location.
    </p>
    <img src="adpointer.png" alt="Image of adjustable pointer pointing at central serbia." class="image">
    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Focus on the map and press <code>J</code> to activate adjustable pointer. Use <code>Up and Down arrows</code> to change the length of the pointer 
            and <code>Left and Right arrows</code> to adjust the angle in which it points.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <code>F</code> to announce the details of the place pointed by the adjustable pointer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <code>Enter</code> to move the cursor to the location pointed by the cursor and continue normal navigation from there.
        </li>
        <li>
            press <code>J</code> again to close adjustable pointer and continue normal navigation from where you stopped.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Ensure you are focused on map and focus mode is on when using this feature.</p>

    <h2 id="distance-finder">Distance finder</h2>
    <p>The Distance Finder helps you calculate road distances between two locations (up to 1500 km). It provides both road distance and estimated travel time.</p>

    <p>
        Press <code>Control +Shift + D </code> to open the distance finder panel. Use tab to focus on the text boxes of starting point and destination and input the places. 
        To select a place, type the name of the place and press Enter. This will bring the results based on your search. Select a place from the result and press enter to select it. You can select the cursor's current location as starting point or destination by pressing <code>Alt + L</code>. 
        Use tab key to focus of find distance button and press enter to announce the distance and time. The screen reader will announce the total road distance between the two points and the estimated time taken for the travel.<br>
        Note: These values may not be accurate.
